        <h2>Projects</h2>

                <li>Space Station Site</li>
                <li>Movie Theater Site</li>
                <li>Portfolio</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        <h3>Space Station Site</h3>
            <p>This is a home page for a Space travel company. It's styled using CSS and contains a
                navbar, image containers, and a form</p>              
        <h3>Movie Theater Site</h3>
            <p>This page is a home page for a movie theater that I made using Bootstrap 4.
                    I utilized the navbar, jumbotron, cards, columns and dropdown components.</p>
        <h3>My Portfolio</h3>
            <p>This page is an example of my first portfolio. I stylized this page with CSS utilizing 
                    elements such as hover and transform effects. I also utilized a few JavaScript elements to make the page a bit more interactive.
